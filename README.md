## Quick Start

> [!TIP]
> For OIDC setup, advanced configuration, or upgrade guides, see the [full documentation](https://grimmory.org/docs/getting-started).

Requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

<details>
<summary><strong>Image Repositories</strong></summary>

| Registry | Image |
| --- | --- |
| Docker Hub | `grimmory/grimmory` |
| GitHub Container Registry | `ghcr.io/grimmory-tools/grimmory` |

</details>

### Step 1: Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file:

```ini
# Application
APP_USER_ID=1000
APP_GROUP_ID=1000
TZ=Etc/UTC

# Database
DATABASE_URL=jdbc:mariadb://mariadb:3306/grimmory
DB_USER=grimmory
DB_PASSWORD=ChangeMe_Grimmory_2025!

# Optional: enable API docs + export OpenAPI JSON (defaults to false)
API_DOCS_ENABLED=false

# Storage: LOCAL (default) or NETWORK (disables file operations; see Network Storage section)
DISK_TYPE=LOCAL

# MariaDB
DB_USER_ID=1000
DB_GROUP_ID=1000
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ChangeMe_MariaDBRoot_2025!
MYSQL_DATABASE=grimmory
```

### Step 2: Docker Compose

Stable images are published from semantic-release tags on `main` as `vX.Y.Z` plus `latest`. Nightly images are built from `develop` and tagged `nightly`.

> [!NOTE]
> Migrating from an existing Booklore container? You can keep your current service name, `container_name`, database name and user, ports, and mounted volumes the same. Replace only the `image:` line with `grimmory/grimmory:<tag>` or `ghcr.io/grimmory-tools/grimmory:<tag>`.

```yaml
services:
  booklore:
    image: grimmory/grimmory:v2.2.1
```

Create a `docker-compose.yml` or copy and adapt [`deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml`](deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml):

```yaml
services:
  grimmory:
    image: grimmory/grimmory:latest
    # Convenience tag:
    # image: grimmory/grimmory:<release-version>
    # Alternative: ghcr.io/grimmory-tools/grimmory:<release-version>
    # To build from source instead: comment out 'image' and uncomment below
    # build: .
    container_name: grimmory
    environment:
      - USER_ID=${APP_USER_ID}
      - GROUP_ID=${APP_GROUP_ID}
      - TZ=${TZ}
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
      - DATABASE_USERNAME=${DB_USER}
      - DATABASE_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
      - API_DOCS_ENABLED=${API_DOCS_ENABLED}
      - DISK_TYPE=${DISK_TYPE}
    depends_on:
      mariadb:
        condition: service_healthy
    ports:
      - "6060:6060"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./books:/books
      - ./bookdrop:/bookdrop
    healthcheck:
      test: wget -q -O - http://localhost:6060/api/v1/healthcheck
      interval: 60s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 60s
      timeout: 10s
    restart: unless-stopped

  mariadb:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/mariadb:11.4.5
    container_name: mariadb
    environment:
      - PUID=${DB_USER_ID}
      - PGID=${DB_GROUP_ID}
      - TZ=${TZ}
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=${MYSQL_DATABASE}
      - MYSQL_USER=${DB_USER}
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - ./mariadb/config:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mariadb-admin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 10
```

### Step 3: Launch

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:6060, create your admin account, and start building your library.

Additional deployment examples:

- Docker Compose: [`deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml`](deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml)
- Helm: [`deploy/helm/grimmory/Chart.yaml`](deploy/helm/grimmory/Chart.yaml)
- Podman Quadlet: [`deploy/podman/quadlet/README.md`](deploy/podman/quadlet/README.md)

## Developer Surfaces


Contributor workflow, PR policy, and release semantics live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). 

General purpose development guidelines live in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md). Component-specific implementation guidance lives in:

- [`backend/DEVELOPMENT.md`](backend/DEVELOPMENT.md)
- [`frontend/DEVELOPMENT.md`](frontend/DEVELOPMENT.md)

The root [`Justfile`](Justfile) is the primary local command surface and mirrors the folder-local `backend/Justfile` and `frontend/Justfile` entrypoints.

```bash
just               # Show root + api + ui recipes
just test          # Run backend and frontend tests
just api test      # Run backend tests only
just ui dev        # Start the frontend dev server
```

---

## API Reference Docs

When enabled via `API_DOCS_ENABLED`, API reference documentation is available as both an `openapi.json` and as publicly accessible docs. The endpoints are:
- API reference docs are available at `http://localhost:6060/api/docs`
- OpenAPI JSON is available at `http://localhost:6060/api/openapi.json`

---

## BookDrop

Drop book files into a watched folder. Grimmory picks them up, pulls metadata, and queues them for your review.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Drop Files] --> B[Auto-Detect]
    B --> C[Extract Metadata]
    C --> D[Review and Import]
```

| Step | What Happens |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Watch | Grimmory monitors the BookDrop folder continuously |
| 2. Detect | New files are picked up and parsed automatically |
| 3. Enrich | Metadata is fetched from Google Books and Open Library |
| 4. Import | You review, adjust if needed, and add to your library |

Mount the volume in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./bookdrop:/bookdrop
```

---

## Usenet Acquisition

Grimmory can automatically search for and download books from Usenet. Configure one or more Newznab-compatible indexers and a SABnzbd download client, then add books to your Wanted list — Grimmory handles the rest.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Discover Books] --> B[Add to Wanted]
    B --> C[Newznab Search]
    C --> D[Confidence Scoring]
    D --> E[SABnzbd Download]
    E --> F[BookDrop Import]
```

| Step | What Happens |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Discover | Search Open Library or Google Books by title, author, or ISBN from the Discover Books page |
| 2. Want | Add a book to the Wanted list from search results or manually |
| 3. Search | Grimmory queries enabled Newznab indexers using title, author, and ISBN |
| 4. Score | Each NZB result is scored for confidence — penalising audiobooks, rewarding ISBN matches |
| 5. Download | Results above the confidence threshold are sent to SABnzbd automatically |
| 6. Import | Completed downloads land in the BookDrop folder for automatic import into your library |

The scheduler runs nightly at 3 AM and retries `Not Found` books up to 5 times before marking them permanently failed. You can also trigger a search for any individual book or run the full batch job on demand from the Wanted Books page.

### Acquisition Setup

1. Navigate to **Settings → Acquisition**
2. Add a Newznab indexer (URL + API key)
3. Add a SABnzbd download client (URL + API key + category)
4. Set the SABnzbd category's completed download folder to match your BookDrop path

Until both an enabled indexer and an enabled download client are configured, scheduled and manual searches are skipped — wanted books stay in `WANTED` and the reason is recorded in each book's job history.

### Acquisition Permissions

The Discover and Wanted Books pages are gated by a `Discover & Wanted Books` permission. Admins always have access; for non-admin users, grant the permission from **Settings → Users → Edit user → Acquisition**. The same permission also gates the acquisition API endpoints.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml — map both volumes to the same path
volumes:
  - ./bookdrop:/bookdrop        # Grimmory BookDrop
  # Set SABnzbd "books" category folder to the same host path: ./bookdrop
```

---

## Network Storage

Set `DISK_TYPE=NETWORK` in your `.env` to run Grimmory against a network-mounted file system (NFS, SMB, etc.).
In this mode, direct file operations (delete, move, rename from the UI) are disabled to avoid destructive changes on shared mounts.
All other features — reading, metadata, sync — remain fully functional.
